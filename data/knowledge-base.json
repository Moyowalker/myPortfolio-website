    "keywords": ["ai", "automation", "llm", "vertex", "claude"],
    "answer": "Every AI initiative starts with a product hypothesis tied to an outcome—throughput, accuracy, cost, or delight. I translate that into measurable KPIs, prototype the workflow with stakeholders, and wrap the LLM experience in guardrails: red teams, human approvals, and telemetry. Vertex, Claude, and OpenAI sit behind a service layer so we can swap or ensemble models depending on risk and latency."

  {
    "prompt": "discovery sprint",
    "keywords": ["discovery", "research", "product", "sprint"],
    "answer": "My discovery sprint runs in three arcs: align on the opportunity and success metrics, run mixed-method research to map jobs-to-be-done, and validate the riskiest assumptions with prototypes. We finish with a lightweight roadmap, prioritised backlog, and instrumentation plan so delivery teams move fast with confidence."

  {
    "prompt": "product engineering collaboration",
    "keywords": ["product", "engineering", "collaboration", "team"],
    "answer": "I anchor collaboration in shared rituals: dual-track discovery, weekly demos, and async scoreboards that track outcomes, not output. Engineers join customer research, PMs own API contracts, and everyone sees the same telemetry. That keeps strategy, design, and delivery tightly looped without sacrificing speed."

  {
    "prompt": "automation",
    "keywords": ["automation", "enterprise", "operations"],
    "answer": "Automation succeeds when it blends business rules with experiential nuance. I co-design the blueprint with operators, define exception paths, and instrument the bots for observability. At Emocom we pair AutomationAnywhere with service layers in Node.js to deliver auditable flows across procurement, OEM management, and customer success."

    "answer": "Each case study on this site details context, approach, and impact. InvoiceEase focuses on AI-assisted billing, DreamLens explores responsible AI in consumer wellness, and the Emocom Milestone Platform shows how we orchestrate enterprise workflows.
