## Challenge
Finance teams for professional services firms relied on brittle spreadsheets and manual approvals. Delays in reconciliation led to missed revenue, poor customer visibility, and limited analytics on recurring engagements.

## Approach
- Ran discovery interviews with finance leads and service managers to map high-friction flows.
- Designed a modular billing data model and role-based permissions aligned to existing ERP integrations.
- Embedded OpenAI + Claude prompts to generate invoice drafts, flag outliers, and recommend payment plans.
- Built dashboards for cash projection and cohort-level churn using MongoDB aggregations and Superset visual layers.

## Outcome
- Reduced invoice preparation time by 63% for early customers.
- Surfaced $120k in previously unbilled services through anomaly detection.
- Enabled self-service customer portals with live status, file uploads, and dispute resolution workflows.
