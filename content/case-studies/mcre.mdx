## Challenge
Marketing teams struggled to keep pace with content demands. Repurposing webinars, podcasts, and long-form articles was manual, inconsistent, and time-intensive.

## Approach
- Partnered with content strategists to codify brand voice, target personas, and compliance flags.
- Built a modular pipeline using LangChain for summarization, excerpt generation, and tone adjustments.
- Added reviewer checkpoints with change tracking so editors could accept or override AI suggestions.
- Delivered analytics on asset performance and feedback loops to continually refine prompts.

## Outcome
- Cut repurposing time from days to under two hours per asset.
- Increased social engagement by 38% thanks to channel-specific optimization.
- Created a knowledge base of approved voice/tone snippets for future automation.
