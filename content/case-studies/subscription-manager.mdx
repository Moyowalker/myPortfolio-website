## Challenge
Fast-scaling startups lacked visibility into overlapping subscriptions, redundant seats, and looming renewals. Finance leadership struggled to project spend and enforce approval workflows.

## Approach
- Built a unified subscription ledger with webhooks, API connectors, and email ingestion.
- Delivered renewal playbooks, approval routing, and payment integrations that mirrored company policy.
- Enabled AI summaries of usage trends so executives understood value vs. spend.
- Added integrations with Slack and email to keep stakeholders in the loop.

## Outcome
- Consolidated 40% of redundant tools within the first quarter.
- Reduced late renewal escalations by 90% thanks to proactive alerting.
- Unlocked category spending dashboards to support annual budgeting cycles.
