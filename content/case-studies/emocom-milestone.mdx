## Challenge
Emocom needed a single pane of glass to coordinate OEM engagements, partner enablement, and customer delivery. Global tools were expensive and failed to reflect local regulatory requirements.

## Approach
- Facilitated product discovery with sales, delivery, and finance stakeholders to capture milestones, approvals, and data handoffs.
- Architected a modular Node.js service layer with MongoDB and Odoo integrations for master data.
- Embedded AutomationAnywhere bots for document triage, SLA tracking, and escalations.
- Delivered dynamic dashboards and notifications so leadership could monitor progress and unblock teams.

## Outcome
- Improved cross-team visibility, reducing handoff delays by 45%.
- Automated document processing, saving ~30 hours per week across operations leads.
- Established a roadmap for AI copilots to assist with proposal drafting and risk identification.
