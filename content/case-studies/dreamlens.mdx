## Challenge
Users wanted more meaningful insights into their dreams beyond generic interpretations. Any solution needed empathy, cultural nuance, and safeguards against overreach.

## Approach
- Partnered with psychologists to define interpretation frameworks grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy.
- Built a Node.js backend that routes prompts between Vertex AI and Claude depending on emotional weight.
- Designed a React front-end with calming motion and journaling flows.
- Added redaction, tone detection, and opt-in data donation for ongoing model fine-tuning.

## Outcome
- 92% of beta testers reported higher clarity on emotional triggers.
- Reduced churn by enabling streak tracking and habit-forming reminders.
- Established responsible AI guardrails with human-in-the-loop review for sensitive submissions.
