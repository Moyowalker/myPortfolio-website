## Challenge
Growing professional services teams relied on both Xero and Odoo but lacked a trustworthy integration path. Manual CSV exports triggered mismatched balances, currency errors, and compliance risks.

## Approach
- Modelled canonical financial objects and reconciliation rules with finance leadership.
- Built a message-driven sync engine in Python with Celery and Redis for resilient retries.
- Leveraged Odoo XML-RPC and Xero SDK for delta-based updates, guarded with hashing and optimistic locking.
- Implemented notification and reporting layers so finance operators could monitor state and self-heal issues.

## Outcome
- Delivered &lt;15 minute delay across ledgers with near-zero duplicate postings.
- Cut reconciliation cycles from days to under two hours.
- Produced auditable trails for regulatory reporting and simplified external audits.
