## Challenge
Schools required a simple way to keep parents informed, manage attendance, and centralize fee collection. Existing tools were fragmented and not tailored to local infrastructure.

## Approach
- Conducted ride-alongs with teachers and admin staff to understand ceremony, meetings, and data entry rituals.
- Built a React Native client with Firebase for realtime messaging and offline caching.
- Introduced modular dashboards for assignments, attendance, and payment collections.
- Added voice note support and localization so communications fit user context.

## Outcome
- Lifted parent response rates by 55% with targeted notifications.
- Reduced late fee collections by 30% due to automated reminders.
- Provided administrators with actionable insights on engagement and retention.
