## Challenge
Local merchants wanted a digital storefront but lacked tools designed for regional delivery constraints. Customers needed predictable ETAs and trust signals to adopt the platform.

## Approach
- Conducted field research with riders and market vendors to capture fulfillment realities.
- Built a Next.js marketplace experience with Node.js APIs and MongoDB for catalog + order management.
- Added delivery tracking, SMS updates, and loyalty mechanics.
- Enabled merchant analytics on order mix, peak hours, and product performance.

## Outcome
- Onboarded 150+ merchants within the first quarter.
- Achieved 88% on-time deliveries through routing heuristics and rider incentives.
- Created a defensible local marketplace with community-driven features.
