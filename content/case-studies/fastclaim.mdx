## Challenge
Insurance providers needed to shorten the time from claim submission to settlement while keeping customers informed. Legacy systems were siloed and offered limited visibility.

## Approach
- Led discovery with handlers, customers, and compliance officers to map claims journeys and pain points.
- Built a modular Node.js and MongoDB backend with rules-driven workflows for escalations.
- Delivered responsive React interfaces for customers, handlers, and management dashboards.
- Added AI-assisted messaging templates to keep customers updated and reduce manual effort.

## Outcome
- Decreased average claim resolution time from weeks to days.
- Increased NPS by delivering proactive notifications and two-way chat.
- Enabled insurers to launch new products faster with configurable workflows and analytics.
