## Challenge
Friends, families, and small co-ops needed a culturally-aware way to split bills, track debts, and settle balances without friction. Existing global apps failed to address local currency nuances and trust cues.

## Approach
- Conducted diary studies with target users in Lagos and Calabar to surface onboarding blockers.
- Architected a React Native stack with MongoDB Realm sync for low bandwidth conditions.
- Embedded Claude prompts to explain calculations in plain language and support negotiation.
- Added escrow-style safeguards and reminders via WhatsApp channels.

## Outcome
- Achieved 76% weekly retention among early adopters.
- Reduced payment disputes by providing AI-generated fairness explanations.
- Enabled households to visualize recurring shared expenses and plan contributions.
